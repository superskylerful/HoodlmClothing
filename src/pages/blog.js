            <p className="BlogText">Hoodlm Clothing will be dropping a new collection Saturday April 20th at 11 AM MTN time. This collection will consist of The "Stuck Dead" Tee In 2 Colors Black And Slate. The Hoodlm 3M "Side Logo" Camp Cap in 2 Colors Black And Camo. Also The super limited Yellow "Illegal Business' Deck. This Release has been worked on for months to make sure everything was made to perfection. After a couple "successful" releases I did know what I wanted to do next. There were all these ideas in my sketch book but I didn't know what to make! I Made the 3M hats in 2018 I had a box of them and only gave a couple to close friends! I teased them on social media but never got around to releasing them. Months would go by and id just see the box sitting I decided to drop them in a collection and started working! The T-Shirts are an inspiration of a Vintage Rock Tee but we threw our own vibe into it! The decks well I just made those to flex! I suck at skateboarding so theres no way I could get sponsored. Whats the way around it? Sponsor myself!! Either way I think I made a sick deck and you guys get to enjoy them! To everybody thats followed the journey thank you! Thanks for taking your time to click on this page and view what we have to bring to you! Your support means tons and I couldn't thank you enough for riding with us! Enjoy the clothes lets just say there is more coming! Stay tuned and keep an eye out for the giving on the Instagram I put a link in the home page so its easy to find for you lazy people out there! If thats to hard to do @hoodlmclothing on Instagram. All love, No hate! If you ain't reppin' Hoodlm, We cant relate. Omar</p>
